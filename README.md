Take-home task for Sylvera

## With more time I would:

- validate response from backend using types - zod
- improve accessibility i.e. use of aria roles and labels
- make component to improve design for scenario where there are no feed entries
- test edge-cases for empty states and boundaries i.e. when feeds is less than 10

## Assumptions

- Top ten is the top of the list returned in response from API, as opposed to based on time entry
- Infrequently and very infrequently have been interpreted as one day and half a day respectively to be the frequency at which we fetch projects and project details

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
